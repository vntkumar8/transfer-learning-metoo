\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
Although we have been able to produce the best AUC score in the grand challenge, several improvements are possible as future work. As we pointed out in Section~\ref{sec:preprocessing}, we have not made use of the images in the tweets. The images containing text can be used after an OCR conversion.  More sophisticated approaches may include use or invention of some advanced architecture to perform classification on the images together with text.
